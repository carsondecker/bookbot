This is a simple book summary program that gives a breakdown of the words in Frankenstein. It requires you to have a file named "frankenstein.txt" in the same folder, you can download it [here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt). This is one of my earliest projects, so it's not very in depth.
