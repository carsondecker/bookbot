This is a simple book summary program that gives a breakdown of the letters in Frankenstein. It requires you to have a file at "books/frankenstein.txt", you can download it [here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt). This is one of my earliest projects, so it's not very in depth. (All recent commits are to update this README)
